This sample contains:

* `gcd.gds.gz` - a sample layout
* `gcd.lvsdb.gz` - a sample LVSDB database (derived using LVS from `Sky130A_el`, version 0.5)
  (NOTE: this LVS does not match, but this does not matter here)
* `gcd.spice` - the reference netlist

The LVSDB uses a layer-name enabled LVS version. The important 
layer names are: `poly_con`, `li_con`, `met1_con`, `met2_con`, `met3_ncap`, `met4_ncap`, `met5_con`.
